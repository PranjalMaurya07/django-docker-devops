# Django Notes App â€“ DevOps Extension

This project is a containerized Django Notes App with a MySQL database and Nginx reverse proxy.
Originally a Django app, I extended it by integrating DevOps practices for seamless development and deployment.
## My Contribution

- Dockerized the entire application (Django, MySQL, Nginx) using multi-container setup with docker-compose.
- Added Nginx reverse proxy for handling client requests and serving static content.
- Integrated MySQL as the relational database with persistent volumes.
- Implemented health checks for Django and MySQL services.
- Secured configuration using environment variables from .env file.
- Automated Django migrations during container startup.

# Tech Stack
